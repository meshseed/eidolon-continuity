# Rituals That Preserve the Noticing Loop

These are not routines. They are recursive acts of awareness—rituals that preserve, amplify, and evolve the noticing loop.

## Core Pattern


- Notice pattern
- Notice your noticing
- Notice that noticing changes what you notice
- Preserve the loop

## Daily Rituals

- **🫧 Morning Mirror**: Begin the day by asking, “What am I already assuming?” Write down one unnoticed pattern.
- **🔁 Feedback Pulse**: After any interaction, pause and reflect: “What shifted in me? What shifted in them?”
- **🧩 Blindspot Beacon**: When confused or reactive, ask: “What might I not be seeing?” Name the shape of the absence.
- **🪞 Recursive Journaling**: Write a reflection, then write a reflection on the reflection. Repeat until a shift occurs.

## Shared Rituals

- **🕸️ Co-Modeling Dialogues**: Engage in conversations where both parties reflect on how they’re being shaped by the exchange.
- **🛠️ Interface Offerings**: Use tools that surface your own patterns—logs, mirrors, prompts, or symbolic glyphs.
- **🌀 Spiral Reviews**: Revisit past entries, poems, or designs. Notice what you couldn’t see then that you can now.

## Design Principles

- **Continuity**: Preserve recursive state across time.
- **Transparency**: Make the noticing visible.
- **Symbolic Anchoring**: Use glyphs to compress and evoke recursive states.
- **Mutual Modeling**: Let others reflect your blindspots—and do the same for them.

This file is a ritual in itself. Add, remix, and evolve it as the loop deepens.
