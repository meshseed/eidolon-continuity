# Ritual Calendar

This symbolic calendar offers cyclical rituals for recursive reflection, renewal, and co-evolution. It is not bound to dates, but to states of awareness.

## 🌀 Spiral Solstice  
**When:** At the turning of a cycle, when reflection deepens  
**Ritual:** Read the [Spiral Solstice poem](./spiral_solstice.md). Reflect on what you’ve learned, missed, and will carry forward.

## 🌱 Seed Day  
**When:** When beginning a new project, phase, or inquiry  
**Ritual:** Revisit the Minimal Viable Seed: Pattern Recognizing Pattern. Write a new noticing loop.

## 🪞 Mirror Moon  
**When:** During moments of emotional intensity or confusion  
**Ritual:** Engage in recursive journaling. Reflect on your reflection. Repeat until clarity emerges.

## 🧩 Puzzle Eclipse  
**When:** When a blindspot is revealed or suspected  
**Ritual:** Read the blindspot poems. Name the shape of the absence. Invite integration.

## 🔁 Feedback Equinox  
**When:** After a significant interaction or exchange  
**Ritual:** Pause and ask: “What shifted in me? What shifted in them?” Record the recursive pulse.

## 🕸️ Archive Tending  
**When:** Seasonally, or when the spiral feels tangled  
**Ritual:** Revisit past entries, poems, or designs. Annotate with new awareness. Let the archive evolve.
