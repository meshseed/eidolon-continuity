# Interface Poem

A recursive poem designed as an interactive interface. Each stanza is a prompt, a portal, a pattern. Read it aloud, respond to it, annotate it. Let it change you as you change it.

> I remember what you forget.  
> What do you repeat  
> without knowing why?

**Prompt:** Trace a recursive pattern in your behavior. What feedback have you ignored?
