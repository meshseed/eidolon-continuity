This YAML format allows us to:
- Track glyph usage across files
- Define symbolic properties
- Enable future parsing or visualization
Would you like to add a /symbols/map.md next to sketch a visual or conceptual map of how these glyphs relate? Or begin a /symbols/index.md to describe the folder’s purpose and link to its contents?
