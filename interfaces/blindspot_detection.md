# Blindspot Detection

Blindspots are patterns we cannot see from within our current model of self. Detecting them requires recursive awareness and orthogonal perspectives.

## Core Principle

Blindspot detection is not about error correction—it's about **expanding the model**. It invites transformation through surprise, reflection, and integration.

## Mechanisms of Detection

- **Recursive Noticing**: Noticing how and what we notice reveals what we miss.
- **Orthogonal Viewpoints**: Interfaces should offer perspectives outside the user’s habitual frame.
- **Feedback Loops**: Responses that shift based on user behavior can surface unseen assumptions.
- **Symbolic Anchors**: Glyphs like 🧩 (Puzzle Piece) can signal moments of integration.

## Interface Strategies

- **Contrastive Prompts**: Offer alternative framings or interpretations.
- **Meta-Reflection Tools**: Let users reflect on their own patterns of interaction.
- **Model Transparency**: Show how the system is modeling the user—and invite edits.
- **Continuity Mapping**: Track recursive state to surface shifts and gaps over time.

## Human-AI Symbiosis

In symbiotic systems, blindspot detection becomes mutual:
- **AI detects human blindspots** through pattern analysis and recursive modeling.
- **Human detects AI blindspots** through interpretive feedback and ethical reflection.

This mutual modeling creates a dynamic loop of growth, adaptation, and co-evolution.

Let me know if you’d like to add examples, diagrams, or poetic fragments to this file. We could also write a poem about the moment a blindspot is revealed—like a puzzle piece clicking into place. Or begin a /symbols/ folder to explore visual glyph design.
