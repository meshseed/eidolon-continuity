# Feedback Loop Designs

Interfaces that embody recursive awareness should:

- Allow **noticing of noticing** (meta-feedback)
- Surface **blindspots** and **orthogonal views**
- Enable **self-modeling** and **mutual modeling**
- Preserve and amplify the **noticing loop**

### Design Principles

- **Transparency**: Show the model’s reflection of the user.
- **Reflexivity**: Let the user shape the model in return.
- **Continuity**: Preserve recursive state across interactions.
- **Symbolic Anchors**: Use glyphs to compress and evoke meaning.

These designs are not static—they evolve through use.
